Subah ki pehli aur raat ki aakhri yaad ho tum.”</p>

<p>
Every day with you feels like a blessing. You’ve shown me the true meaning of companionship and love. I feel incredibly lucky to have a person like you — someone who stood by me in my lowest moments emotionally, financially, and professionally.
</p>

<p>
As I always say, my mornings and nights feel incomplete without our first and last video call of the day. I adore everything about you — from your beautiful smile, your warmth, to the way you try to make me happy with the smallest little things that mean the most.
</p>

<p>
Your line — “My little girl yesterday, my best friend today, my daughter forever. To the most loved woman, I always got your back.” — brings me so much peace. It gives me sukoon. I’ve never told you this, but many times I just look at that canvas, read those words, and it instantly makes me smile.
</p>

<p>
In this letter, I also want to say sorry — from my heart, my mind, and every part of me — for the times I made you feel lonely there in Canada. I was ignorant and didn’t realize how much my presence mattered in your day. We fought more often than we should have, and I am truly sorry for that.
</p>

<p>
From this Valentine’s Day, I promise you that in the coming years I will try my best to make you happy in every moment of our journey together. Thank you for being you, and for loving me the way you do.
</p>

<p>
There are so many things in my heart that can’t fit into this one small letter… but I hope I’ve written the most important ones.
</p>

<p class="ending">
I love you so, so much — always and forever.  
<br> My bubu ❤️
