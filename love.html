      <li>You have helped me become the woman I am today — strong, loyal, and independent.</li>

      <li>You have taught me the difference between honesty and confrontation, and how to handle things with maturity.</li>

      <li>My productive nature and my desire to learn new things the right way exist because of you and your guidance.</li>

      <li>You don’t carry ego or a wrong attitude. When you feel hurt, you express it instead of letting it turn into ego — I truly realized this after our last conversation.</li>

      <li>You care about me every single day in ways both big and small.</li>

      <li>I love the way you call me “bubu” — it always makes me feel so loved and special.</li>

      <li>Whatever I am today is because of you, which is why you are always the first person in my prayers.</li>

      I want to be with you for a lifetime so I can keep discovering more and more reasons why I am so deeply in love with you.

      I love you so, so much ❤️
